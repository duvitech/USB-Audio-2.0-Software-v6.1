Previous L1 Firmware Releases
=============================

3v30:
    - ADDED:      Added support for protocol Stall for un-recognised requests to Endpoint 0.
                  BOS Descriptor test in latest version of USB CV test now passes.
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Removed redundant delays in DFU image download.  This aids Windows DFU reliability. 
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) DFU Run-time descriptors updated from DFU 1.0 to DFU 1.1 spec.  This allows USB CV test pass.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) MIDI string descriptors added to string table.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) bInterval value for feedback endpoint modified to be more compatible with Microsoft OSs 
                  (support for iso endpoints with bInterval > 8 microframes).  This aids compatibility with 3rd party 
                  drivers for USB 3.0 controllers.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Fixed build failure when NUM_USB_CHAN_IN/NUM_USB_CHAN_OUT defined as 0. Previous INPUT/OUTPUT 
                  defines now based on NUM_USB_CHAN_XXX defines. 
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Removed redundant calls to assert() to free memory. 


3v20:
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Fixed reset reliability for self-powered devices.  This was due to an issue with 
                  XUD/Endpoint synchronisation during communication of RESET bus state over channels.
                  Bus powered devices should not be effected due to power up on every plug event.  
                  Note: Changes limited to XUD library only.

3v11:
    - RESOLVED    (Major) Removed size in re-interpret cast of DFU data buffer (unsigned to unsigned char). This
                  was due to a new optimisation in the 11.2 compiler which removes part of the DFU buffer (dfu.xc)
                  as it considers it un-used.  This causes the DFU download request to fail due to stack corruption.
3v10: 
    - ADDED:      Re-added LEDA "Valid Host" functionality using VendorHostActive() call. This functionality
                  missing since 3v00.  Note LED now indicated "Valid Host" rather than "Suspend" condition
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Fixed issue when sharing bus with other devices especially high throughput bulk devices 
                  (e.g. hard disk drive). This is issue typically caused SOFs to missed by the device 
                  resulting in incorrect feedback calculation and ultimately audio glitching.  Note: this effects
                  XUD library only.
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Intermittent issues with device chirp could lead to a bad packet on bus and device not
                  being properly detected as high-speed.  This was due to opmode of transceiver sometimes 
                  not being set before chirp. Note: this effects XUD library only.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Intermittent USB CV Test fails with some hub models. Caused by test issuing suspend
                  during resume signalling. Note: this effects XUD library only                
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) bMaxPower now set to 10mA (was 500mA) since this is a self-powered design (see 
                  SELF_POWERED define)
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Added code to deal with malformed audio packets from a misbehaving driver.
                  Previously this could result in the device audio buffering raising an exception.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) First packet of audio IN stream now correct to current sample-rate.  
                  Previously first packet was of length relating to previous sample rate.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) MIDI OUT buffering code simplified.  Now a single buffer used instead 
                  of previous circular buffer.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Audio OUT stream buffer pre-fill level increased.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Under stressed conditions the Windows built in Audio Class 1.0 driver (usbaudio.sys)
                  may issue invalid sample frequencies (e.g. 48001Hz) leading to an unresponsive device. 
                  Additional checks added to cope with this.

3v02:
    - RESOLVED:   Windows build issue (#9681)

3v01:
    - RESOLVED:   Version number reported as 0x0200, not 0x0300 (#9676)

3v00:
    - ADDED:      Added support to allow easy addition of custom audio requests
    - ADDED:      Optional "Host Active" function calls 
    - RESOLVED:   Single sample delay between ADC L/R channels resolved (#8783)
    - RESOLVED:   Use of MIDI cable numbers now compliant to specification (#8892)
    - RESOLVED:   Improved USB interoperability and device performance when connected through chained hubs 
    - RESOLVED:   S/PDIF Tx channel status bits (32-41) added for improved compliance
    - RESOLVED:   Increased robustness of high-speed reset recovery

    - Device falls back to Audio Class 1.0 when connected via a full-speed hub
    - DFU functionality added

1v45:
    - Suspend/Resume supported.  LED A indicates suspend condition
    - LED B now indicates presence of audio stream
    - Code refactor for easy user customisation

1v30:
    - Fixed feedback issue in 1v2 release of USB library xud.a (used 3-byte feedback)
    
1v20:
    - Device now enumerates correctly on Windows
    
1v10:
    - Device enumerates as 24bit (previously 32bit)
    - Bit errors at 96kHz and 192kHz resolved
    - S/PDIF output functionality added
    - 88.2KHz analog in/out and S/PDIF output added
    - 176.4KHz analog in/out added.  S/PDIF not supported at this frequency because it requires 2xMCLK. 
	  Board has 11.2896Mhz, and would require 22.579Mhz.
